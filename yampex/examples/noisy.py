"""
A grid of subplots that each show a pair of amplitude-modulated
waveforms at different time scales.

Illustrates the use of L{options.OptsBase.use_timex} and calls to a
subplot-context instance of L{plot.Plotter} with multiple y-axis
arguments.

Also illustrates how simply a row can be made twice as high as the
others.
