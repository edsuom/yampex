    Clips the most positive and negative deviations of vector I{X} to

    the second-most positive (or negative) value and the median. Adds
    annotations to subplotting context tool I{sp} indicating the

    Set I{annEnd} C{True} to add an annotation at the end of the
    subplot.

    Call your context tool I{sp} with the clipped result however you
    wish, and the subplot will have the annotations.
